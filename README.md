# 2D Ising Model - Neural Networks
- In this project, we explored the application of neural networks in order to perform classification of the ordered/unordered phases of the 2D Ising model, and thus determining the critical point of the 2D Ising model.
- The Metroplis-Hastings algorithm was used to perform monte carlo simulations in order to generate the corresponding tranining and testing samples.
